                WHY IS IT BETTER TO HIRE PHOTO AND VIDEO FROM ONE TEAM?
              </h3>
              <p class="wedding__faq-text">
                Wedding photographers and videographers are performing the same job, and to do it well they need the
                same elements- flattering angles, good lighting, right timing.When they work as a team, their working
                process resembles a dance where each one knows how to move, so both of them get what they need. They
                focus on this flow instead of competing with each other for the best material, as it often happens when
                two strangers are hired, each to do his own business.

              </h3>
              <p class="wedding__faq-text">
                Most of our clients give us the full creative power over their wedding photos and videos and trust that
                we will use our skills and knowledge to polish it to its maximum potential. However, sometimes clients
                request a specific style of colouring or a particular soundtrack for their videos, and that is fine with
                us.

              </h3>
              <p class="wedding__faq-text">
                Yes, we colour grade our materials identically in order to maintain a uniform style. Most of our clients
                prefer natural looking colour correction, with deep hues and timeless feel to it, so that is what we
                strive for unless requested differently.

                HOW MANY PHOTOS CAN I EXPECT?
              </h3>
              <p class="wedding__faq-text">
                We submit around 70-100 HQ edited photos per one hour of coverage. If it's a 10 hours coverage, you get
                around 1000 photos, but it also depends on how busy your wedding day is. If you have many ceremonies,
                rituals and performances, you may expect this amount to double.

                WHAT ARE TURNAROUND TIMES?
              </h3>
              <p class="wedding__faq-text">
                For photography, the turnaround is one month. We also send you around ten edited pictures within two
                days after the wedding so you can share them with your relatives right away.
                For the video, the deadline is three months from the moment the client has chosen a soundtrack. It
                depends on the season, but usually, we submit videos after roughly a month and a half.

                WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR SILENT COVERAGE?
              </h3>
              <p class="wedding__faq-text">
                We use mirrorless cameras that don't have a clicking mechanism, so our photo cameras are silent. You
                won't hear any distracting noises during the ceremony or at any other time, as well as on your
                video.
                Also, it means that our cameras can take more frames per second, ensuring that we capture every moment.
